## Welcome!

You can call me Ari. My pronouns are _he/him/his_.

### Research

I am a research assistant at both the Unversity of Denver Department of
Psychology and Harvard Business School Negotiations, Organizations, and 
Markets Unit. My advisors are [Peter Sokol-Hessner](http://www.sokolhessnerlab.com/) and [Amit Goldenberg](https://amitgoldenberg.com/),
respectively. 

My research is focused on the influences affect and monetary incentives on individual 
and group behaviors, especially in uncertain and high-stakes situations.
A primary question I hope to answer is "In what ways do emotions and money
lead members of a group to collaborate or compete?" 

The methods of investigation I use range from online survey experiments to
computationally-intensive agent-based modeling to natural language processing.
For instance, I previously investigated models of collective emotional 
dynamics in the Stanford Psychophysiology Lab while 
studying Symbolic Systems at Stanford University.

While my scientific pursuits are squarely situated in psychology and
organizational behavior, my past experiences in physics, finance, food culture, 
and technology are wholly responsible for bringing me to this point.

### Contact

I believe in the power of collaboration. If you're interested in
learning more about research opportunities in psychology or 
learning about how to incorporate principles of software engineering 
into scientific research, I encourage you to reach out. I'd be happy to chat and see how I can help.

#### Mentoring

If you are a high school or undergraduate student interested in computational
methods in psychology, please say hello. I was fortunate enough to work with
fantastic mentors very early in my career, and can only hope to provide that
same fortune to those at the beginning of their journeys.
