## Hello :wave:

I am an incoming PhD student in Social Psychology and a Centennial Fellow at Princeton University (starting Fall 2021). My research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence to facilitate collective problem-solving and collaborative processes on a global scale. With a breadth of experiences across physics, mathematics, finance, and software, I hope to bring modern tools to the forefront of the social sciences, with a nod toward increased interdisciplinary work between fields.
