## Welcome!

I am a research assistant at both the Unversity of Denver and Harvard Business
School. In my work, I aim to understand how individual and group
decisions are impacted by affect and incentives. Previously, I investigated 
models of collective emotional dynamics in the Stanford 
Psychophysiology Lab while studying Symbolic Systems at Stanford University.
