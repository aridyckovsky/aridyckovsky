## Welcome!

You can call me Ari. My pronouns are _he/him/his_.

### Research

I am a research assistant at both the Unversity of Denver and Harvard Business
School. In my work, I aim to understand how individual and group
decisions are impacted by affect and incentives. Previously, I investigated 
models of collective emotional dynamics in the Stanford 
Psychophysiology Lab while studying Symbolic Systems at Stanford University.

While my scientific pursuits are squarely situated in psychology and
organizational behavior, my past experiences in physics, finance, food culture, 
and technology are wholly resopnsible for bringing me to this point.

### Contact

I believe in the power of collaboration. If you're interested in a career in
psychology or learning about how to incorporate principles of software engineering 
into scientific research, I encourage you to reach out to aridyckovsky@gmail.com. I'd be happy to chat and see how I can help.
