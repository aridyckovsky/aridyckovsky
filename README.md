## Hello :wave:

I am a PhD student in social psychology at Princeton University, where I use an interdisciplinary approach grounded in psychological dynamics to research the underlying collective processes that lead to the emergence of value in blockchain systems. My experiences prior to pursuing this doctoral degree span quantum physics, capital markets, data analytics, and organizational behavior. Overall, I strive to make substantial and sustainable improvements to society through a scientifically grounded, technologically advanced approach. I have tried to realize this goal by (a) creating service programs to make scientific research more equitable and inclusive, (b) developing publicly available software to aid social science researchers, and (c) using problem-focused approaches to enhance cooperation throughout society.
