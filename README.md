## Hello :wave:

You can call me Ari. My pronouns are _he/him/his_. I'm a research assistant at 
both the Unversity of Denver Department of Psychology and Harvard Business School 
Negotiations, Organizations, and  Markets Unit. My advisors are 
[Peter Sokol-Hessner](http://www.sokolhessnerlab.com/) 
and [Amit Goldenberg](https://amitgoldenberg.com/), respectively. Previously,
I worked in the Stanford Psychopathology Lab and at the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology.

### Area of Interest

What leads members of a group to collaborate or compete? What are the roles of affect
and incentives in fostering or inhibiting that collaboration, and how do situational 
uncertainty or importance modulate these effects? In my research I seek answers to 
these questions, and in turn, Iâ€™m interested in predicting group compositions that are 
more likely to succeed, and in understanding how membersâ€™ attitudes toward each 
other affect the likelihood of collaboration.

Iâ€™ve pursued these and related questions using methods including online survey experiments, 
computationally-intensive agent-based modeling, and natural language processing. As I continue
to uncover the many factors influencing group dynamics, I welcome the opportunity to use
new tools and techniques to understand them.

### Contact

I believe in the power of collaboration. If you're interested in
learning more about research opportunities in psychology or how to incorporate principles of software engineering 
into scientific research, I encourage you to reach out. I'd be happy to chat 
and see how I can help. My email address can be found under my profile 
picture here on GitHub.

#### Mentoring

If you are a high school or undergraduate student interested in applying computational
methods in psychology, please say hello. I was fortunate enough to work with
fantastic mentors very early in my career, and can only hope to provide that
same fortune to those at the beginning of their journeys.
