## Hello :wave:

You can call me Ari. My pronouns are _he/him/his_. I am both a lab manager in the 
University of Denver Department of Psychology and research assistant in the Harvard Business School 
Negotiations, Organizations, and  Markets Unit. My advisors are 
[Peter Sokol-Hessner](http://www.sokolhessnerlab.com/) 
and [Amit Goldenberg](https://amitgoldenberg.com/), respectively. Previously,
I worked in the Stanford Psychopathology Lab and at the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology.

### Why will some groups succeed, while others will fail?

I am interested in understanding **how and when a group’s members work together to reach collective goals**.

- What are the roles of affect and incentives in fostering or inhibiting collaboration? 
- How might changing stakes or uncertainty affect whether individuals within a group collaborate or compete, and how they collectively perform?

I’ve pursued these and related questions using methods including online survey and social media experiments, computationally-intensive agent-based modeling, and natural language processing.

### Contact

I believe in the power of collaboration. If you're interested in
learning more about research opportunities in psychology or how to incorporate principles of software engineering 
into scientific research, I encourage you to reach out. I'd be happy to chat 
and see how I can help. My email address can be found under my profile 
picture here on GitHub.

#### Mentoring

If you are a high school or undergraduate student interested in applying computational
methods in psychology, please say hello. I was fortunate enough to work with
fantastic mentors very early in my career, and can only hope to provide that
same fortune to those at the beginning of their journeys.
